Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    Installs all the dependencies.

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject

    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  [1m<executable> -loadjson[0m
  [1mcd <name>[0m
  [1mnpm install[0m
  [1mnpm start[0m

Happy hacking!
